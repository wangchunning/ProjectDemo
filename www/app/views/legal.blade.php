        <small><p>Before the Customer accesses Anying Online Services through the web or by telephone and engages in a trade, the Customer shall self-identify by entering or providing the required Password.  If Anying assigned a Password to the Customer, the Customer must change it to a new Password of the Customer’s choice.

          <p>Before Anying shall consider each trade to be final, the Customer must clearly authorise, consent to, accept and finalize each Trade using Anying Online Services.  Anying shall deem a trade done when the Customer, in the following order, performs the following: </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Enters the Customer’s Password and accesses Anying Online Services through the web or provides the password verbally by telephone. </li>

          </ol>

          <p>At the Customer’s completion of these steps, Anying accepts the trade as final and is legally binding on the Customer.</p></small>

        <h5>8.2 Signing Officers and Authorised Users</h5>
        <p><b>Signing Officer</b></p>

        <small><p>The Customer will, through its Signing Officer, provide Anying with a list of Authorised Users that it has authorised to: enter into Trades on the Customer’s behalf; otherwise access and use Anying Online Services on its behalf; and to provide Anying with settlement and delivery instructions for completed Trades on its behalf.  The Customer is responsible for keeping Authorised Users’ contact information accurate and up-to-date.</p>

          <p>The Customer represents that its Authorised Users are authorised to enter into this Agreement and that any Trade by Authorised Users will be enforceable against the Customer. Any prior restrictions on the authority of Authorised Users, as defined herein, are hereby revoked. An Authorised User’s authority to trade and otherwise use Anying Online Services shall remain valid and enforceable against the Customer unless they specifically advise Anying that restrictions apply to an Authorised User’s authority to enter into Trades and otherwise use Anying Online Services.</p>
          <p>The Customer understands that, notwithstanding the facts that the Authorised Users must individually enter into a separate Anying Online User Agreement and be assigned their own Passwords, the Authorised User’s access to, and use of Anying Online Services is made solely on behalf of the Customer and the Customer agrees that it is responsible for the acts, errors and omissions of the Authorised User as if the Customer had performed those acts or made those errors and/or omissions itself.</p></small>

        <p><b>Authorised Users</b></p>

        <small><p>An Authorised User, authorised by a Signing Officer, shall be able to enter into Trades on the Customer’s behalf; otherwise access and use Anying Online Services on their behalf; and to provide Anying with settlement and delivery instructions for completed Trades on their behalf, and the Authorised User:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>represents that they have full discretionary authority to purchase and sell Currencies on behalf of the Customer and that each Trade entered into on their behalf will be enforceable byAnying against them in accordance with its terms.</li>
            <li>understands that all information concerning trades made, or use of any Anying Online Services used by it, as an Authorised User, will be made available by Anying to the Customer on whose behalf the Authorised User acts.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>The Authorised User will have the authority to correct, change, verify or send data on the Customer’s behalf, send information and communications to and from Anying, or access the Customer’s electronic communications and financial data.</P>
          <p>The Authorised User will not have the authority to further authorise other persons to trade and otherwise access and use Anying Online Services on the behalf of a Customer on whose behalf the Authorised User may trade or otherwise access and use Anying Online Services.</p>
          <p>Anying is not required to obtain the Authorised User(s) signature or the actual evidence of the Authorised User’s appointment – rather, the Signing Officer is confirming that they have collected the relevant information about the Authorised User.</p></small>

        <h5>8.3 Representations Made For Each Trade</h5>

        <small><p>All representations made in this Agreement with regard to trades shall apply each and every time the Customer accepts, finalizes and enters into a Trade.</p></small>

        <h5>8.4 Indemnification</h5>

        <small><p>The Customer indemnifies and holds harmless Anying from and against all claims made against it, costs, losses and expenses incurred by Anying arising out of, or in respect of, any claim that an employee or other person who uses the Customer’s password was not authorised to enter into a Trade on the Customer’s behalf and/or provide Anying with settlement and delivery instructions for completed Trades. This indemnity will survive the completion of any Trade or the termination of this Agreement.</p>
          <p>As an Authorised User, the Customer will indemnify and hold harmless Anying from and against all claims made against it, costs, losses and expenses incurred by Anying arising out of, or in respect of, any claim by a Customer that the Authorised User was not validly authorised or authorised at all to enter into or perform a Trade for a Customer or that a Trade for them is otherwise not enforceable against them by Anying. This indemnity will survive the completion of any Trade or the termination of this Agreement.</p></small>

        <h5>8.5 Responsibility for Authorised and Unauthorised Access</h5>

        <small><p>All transactions must be completed using the logins and passwords allocated to the Customer by Anying and valid entry of such a login and password will constitute an authorisation by the Customer to complete the Order specified irrespective of whether the login and password are entered by an Authorised User.</p>
          <p>The Customer must ensure that the logins and passwords are kept secure and confidential. The Customer must also ensure that each Authorised User to whom a login and password is provided, will keep them secure and confidential. The Customer will advise Anying immediately if the Customer has any reason to believe that the login and passwords allocated to the Customer have not been kept secure and confidential.
          The Customer will manage and control access to Anying Online and the ability to conduct trades and receive other services, by strictly managing and controlling access to the Customer’s password.</p>

          <p>It is the Customer’s responsibility to ensure that Authorised Users are properly authorised to trade and otherwise use Anying Online Services on the Customer’s behalf, and it is the Customer’s responsibility to ensure that an Authorised User, authorised to act on its behalf, enters into a Anying Online User Agreement and receive their own Password as required above.</p>

          <p>It is the Customer’s responsibility to ensure that the Customer Password(s) do not become known to other parties, including Authorised Users, who are also required to enter their own User Agreement and obtain their own Passwords.</p>

          <p>All Trades and other uses of Anying Online Services conducted through the Customer’s password, whether they are by Authorised Users or otherwise, are the Customer’s responsibility and will be legally binding on the Customer. The Customer shall indemnify and hold harmless Anying from and against any claims for damages, losses, costs, fees and expenses incurred by Anying arising out of or in respect of any unauthorised use of the Customer’s password and this indemnity will survive the completion of any Trade or the termination of this Agreement.</p>

          <p>The Customer will not be responsible for any unauthorised use or trade that occurs after Anying has acknowledged to the Customer in writing receipt from the Customer of a direction to terminate use of the Password used.</p>
          <p>The Customer must immediately notify Anying when any new person becomes an Authorised User or when any existing Authorised User is no longer entitled to be an Authorised User.</p></small>

        <h5>8.6 Trade Confirmation</h5>

        <small><p>The terms of each Trade will be set out in the Trade confirmation presented to the Customer (as the person making the trade) on the Trade confirmation screen, which follows the Customer acceptance of the Trade.  For Trades completed by telephone, the Trade confirmation will be delivered by email or facsimile. The Trade confirmation is evidence of the completed Trade and the terms of the completed Trade.</p>

          <p>The Trade will not be invalidated if, for any reason, the Trade confirmation is not presented to the Customer by Anying Online on the Trade confirmation screen as a result of a computer malfunction or any other reason. If, for any reason, the Trade confirmation is not presented to the Customer, the records of Anying with respect to that Trade will constitute conclusive evidence of the terms of the Trade. If a Trade confirmation is not presented to the Customer for any reason, the Customer should notify Anying immediately by calling the Customer Support Number, and Anying may provide the Customer with a confirmation by email or other means setting out the terms of the Trade. The Customer must promptly verify all Orders to ensure that the details of those Orders match the Customer’s records and the Customer will report any discrepancies to Anying on the same day.</p></small>

          <small><p>The Customer must provide Anying with details of the Nominated Beneficiary Account prior to or on the date stated in the confirmation, or otherwise specified orally or in writing by Anying. Anying will rely on the account number specified for the Nominated Beneficiary Account and will not check to ensure that the name provided by the Customer accords with the account number.</p>
            <p>The Customer shall indemnify and hold harmless Anying from any and all liabilities, claims, costs, expenses and damages of any nature, arising out of or relating to the Nominated Beneficiary Account being inaccessible for any reason.</p></small>

        <h5>8.8 Payment for Trade</h5>

        <small><p>Once a Trade has been finalized and entered into following the Customer’s acceptance, the Customer must make each payment or delivery required to be made by it under the terms of the Trade in the Currency, in the amount, on the date and in accordance with the settlement instructions for the Trade, as set out in the related Trade confirmation.</p>

          <p>The Customer must ensure that the bank account from which the Customer payment obligations under a Trade are to be made, (i) is in the name of the Customer; and (ii) contains sufficient cleared funds to settle the Trade on the Value Date for the Trade. If the bank account does not contain sufficient cleared funds to settle the Trade, the Customer will be liable for any resulting fees payable by Anying with respect to the non-sufficient funds in accordance with the terms under which the Customer holds such account. For payments funded electronically, Anying shall allow a reasonable period after the Value Date for the transaction to clear.</p>

          <p>The Customer shall indemnify and hold harmless Anying from and against any claims made against it, costs, losses and expenses incurred by Anying arising out of, or in respect of, any Customer misrepresentation as to the bank account ownership.  This indemnity will survive the completion of any Trade or the termination of this Agreement.</p>

          <p>If the Customer fails to settle the Trade on the Value Date for the Trade, Anying may, without limiting any other remedies that it may have, in its absolute discretion cancel the Trade, in which case the Customer will have to reimburse Anying for any and all costs and expenses incurred by Anying when it cancels the Trade and the Customer shall hold Anying harmless for any losses suffered by the Customer or any third party as a result of cancellation of the Trade.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Customer agrees that the Customer shall be liable to Anying for all of the following arising out of the Customer breach of contract:</p>
          <ol>
           <li>general damages for all our loss of profit and foreign exchange losses suffered by us;</li>
           <li>an administration charge of $100.00 U.S.;</li>
           <li>any and all bank charges that we incur due to the Customer default with us;</li>
           <li>Anying's legal costs on a solicitor and client basis incurred as a result of the Customer default with us.</li>
          </ol>
        </small>

        <h5>8.9 Trade Incorporated Into Agreement</h5>

        <small><p>Each trade is subject to this Agreement and the terms of each Trade set out in the related Trade confirmation are incorporated into this Agreement and form a part of this Agreement. This Agreement and the terms of each Trade together form the agreement between the Customer and Anying and together constitute a single agreement between the Customer and Anying. If there is any inconsistency between this Agreement and a Trade confirmation, the Trade confirmation will govern.</p></small>

        <h5>8.10 Cancellation of Trade</h5>

        <small>
          <p>If, for any reason, the Customer wants to cancel a Trade that has been finalized and entered into the Customer may notify Anying by calling the Customer Support Number. Anying may or may not have the ability to cancel the Trade.  The Customer understands that it is prudent to contact Anying immediately to make such a request.</p>

          <p>Anying may, at its sole discretion, use reasonable efforts to cancel the Trade, but the Customer understands and acknowledges that once the Trade has been finalised and entered into it is the Customer’s binding obligation and Anying is not required to cancel the Trade.</p>

          <p>If, after reasonable efforts are made by Anying, it is determined the Trade is cancellable, then Anying may cancel the Trade, but the cancellation of any such trade will be entirely within the sole and absolute discretion of Anying.</p>

          <p>If a trade is cancelled by Anying at the Customer’s request, the Customer must reimburse Anying for any expenses incurred by Anying when it cancels the trade.</p></small>

        <h5>8.11 Date of Trade</h5>

        <small><p>If the Customer selects the Value Date for the settlement of a Trade that is not a Business Day in the legal jurisdiction in which any of the bank accounts from which the Customer will be making or receiving payment for a Trade resides (i.e. if the account is maintained at a bank in that jurisdiction), the Value Date for the Trade will be the first day following the Value Date that the Customer selected that is a Business Day in each of the jurisdictions in which such accounts reside, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Trade confirmation.</p>

          <p>Anying will use commercially-reasonable efforts to process the Customer transactions in an expeditious manner. Anying cannot control and is not responsible for the time it takes financial institutions to settle accounts. If a transaction is processed on the next business day for whatever reason, Anying will not, in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct, be responsible for failure, delays or errors in the completion of the transaction.</p></small>

        <h5>8.12 Rejection of Trade</h5>

        <small><p>Anying reserves the right to reject any Trade that is incorrect, incomplete or unsatisfactory to Anying for any reason and Anying is not required to provide reasons for its decision.</p></small>

        <h5>8.13 Corrections To Trade</h5>

          <small><p>In the event that the Customer notices an error in the confirmation, objects to the confirmation, or believes that an unauthorised party has made a Trade on the Customer’s behalf (collectively referred to in this section as an "Objection"), the Customer must call the Customer Support Number immediately.</p>

            <p>Within twenty-four (24) hours after calling the Customer Support Number, any such Objection must be confirmed in writing to Anying, and it shall be deemed received only if actually delivered or mailed by registered mail, return receipt requested, to Anying at its principal address or if sent by email, with confirmation of receipt from Anying. If the Customer fails to object within the time frames specified Anying will deem that the Customer ratified the Trade.</p></small>

        <h5>8.14 Errors</h5>

        <small><p>If the Customer or any unauthorised user makes an error in the process of entering a Trade, the Customer agrees that Anying will not be responsible for any losses the Customer incurs or delays the Customer experience as a result of such an error. Anying's inability or failure to detect and notify the Customer of any error the Customer makes, regardless of the nature of such error, shall not result in Anying being held responsible for any losses suffered by the Customer, including but not limited to in connection with delays the Customer experiences or costs the Customer incurs as a result of such error.</p>

          <p>The Customer agrees to indemnify and hold Anying harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages and costs, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees and out-of-pocket expenses, arising out of or related to any error that the Customer fails to correct or arrange for Anying to correct. This indemnification shall be binding upon the Customer and will survive termination of this Agreement.</p></small>

        <h5>8.15 Reversing Trade</h5>

        <small><p>The Customer may request that a Trade be reversed or amended. Anying may, at its sole discretion, attempt to reverse or amend the Trade. Anying has no obligation to cancel or amend a Trade. Anying shall not be liable if any such request to cancel or amend a Trade is not effected, nor shall Anying be liable for any service charges or currency rate differences involved in reversing or amending a Trade.</p>

          <p>If a trade is reversed by Anying at the Customer’s request, the Customer must reimburse Anying for any expenses, costs or losses incurred by Anying when it reverses the trade.</p></small>

        <h5>8.16 Quoting Error</h5>

        <small><p>Should a quoting error occur due to a typo or obvious mistake in a quote, Anying will not be liable for any damages, claims, losses, liabilities or costs arising from the quoting error. Anying reserves the right to make the necessary adjustments to correct the quoting error. Any dispute arising from such quoting errors will be resolved on the basis of the fair market value, as determined by Anying, in its sole discretion, of the relevant Currency at the time the quoting error occurred.</p></small>

        <h5>8.17 Default Interest</h5>

        <small><p>If the Customer fails to pay any amount payable by it under this Agreement, it shall immediately on demand by Anying pay interest at the rate of 5% above the prevailing 3 month Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate as published by the Reserve Bank of Australia on the overdue amount from its due date up to the date of actual payment, both before, on and after judgment.</p></small>

        <h5>8.18 Authorisation Limits</h5>
        <small>
          <ol>
            <li>The Customer may inform Anying of an Authorisation Limit applicable to some or all orders including Forward Contracts (either individually or in aggregate or both) either in general or for particular Authorised Users.</li>
            <li>Any Authorisation Limit provided by the Customer to Anying may be withdrawn by the Customer at any time by giving Notice to Anying.</li>
          </ol>
        </small>

        <h5>8.19 Telephone Recording</h5>

        <small><p>The Customer acknowledges and agrees, and will ensure that each Authorised User acknowledges and agrees, that Anying may make an electronic recording of each telephone instruction received from an Authorised User which recording remains the property of Anying.  The telephone recording can be used by Anying to confirm the terms and conditions of any transaction where there is dispute with a Customer as to the terms or conditions of the transaction.</p></small>

      <div class="col-lg-8">
        <h4>9. Forward Exchange Contracts</h4>

        <h5>9.1 Forward Contract</h5>

        <small><p>The Customer may buy or sell currency for the purpose of hedging the risk of movement in the value of a currency (for commercial and not for speculation or investment purposes) by placing an Order with Anying specifying the currency, amount of currency, and the Value Date (the “Forward Contract”). At the option of the Customer the delivery of the currency pursuant to the Forward Contract may be either: (a) processed on the Value Date (the “Fixed Term Forward Contract”), or (b) processed in multiple draw downs at any time between the acceptance of the Forward Contract and the Value Date (the “Optional Delivery Date Forward Contract”).</p></small>

        <h5>9.2 Pre-delivery of Fixed Term Forward Contract</h5>

        <small><p>At the request of the Customer, Anying may, at its sole discretion, deliver the currency pursuant to the Fixed Term Forward Contract prior to the Value Date (the “Fixed Term Pre-delivery Date”). For any such pre-delivery, an adjusted rate of exchange calculated on the Fixed Term Pre-delivery Date may be applied at the sole discretion of Anying.</p></small>

        <h5>9.3 Optional Commencement Date</h5>

        <small><p>Pursuant to the terms of the Optional Delivery Date Forward Contract, the Customer may request that the delivery of the multiple draw downs commence on a specific date (the “Optional Commencement Date”).</p></small>

        <h5>9.4 Pre-delivery of Optional Delivery Date Forward Contract</h5>

        <small><p>At the request of the Customer, Anying may, at its sole discretion, deliver the multiple draw downs pursuant to the Optional Delivery Date Forward Contract prior to the Optional Commencement Date (the “Optional Pre-delivery Date”). For any such pre-delivery, an adjusted rate of exchange calculated on the Optional Pre-delivery Date may be applied at the sole discretion of Anying.</p></small>

        <h5>9.5 Extension of Forward Contract</h5>

        <small><p>Anying may at its discretion allow the terms of the Forward Contract to be extended. If Anying agrees to such a change, the Customer agrees that the existing Forward Contract will be terminated based on a rate as determined by Anying and a new Forward Contract will be entered into which reflects the agreed changes. The Customer acknowledges that the exchange rates for the new Forward Contract and for the termination of the original Forward Contract may differ from those in the original Forward Contract. The Customer agrees that all losses and costs in relation to any termination and new Forward Contract are the responsibility of the Customer and must be paid within 2 days of termination of the original Forward Contract.</p></small>

        <h5>9.6 Deposit</h5>

        <small><p>The acceptance by Anying of a Forward Contract for booking shall be conditioned upon Customer’s delivery of funds equal to 10% of the currency value of the Forward Contract or an irrevocable letter of guarantee satisfactory to Anying in order to validate the Forward Contract (the “Deposit”). The Deposit may either be by way of: (a) a deposit (in Australian dollar funds or such other currency agreed to by the parties, only delivered by bank wire or other means acceptable to Anying) of a certain mutually agreed percentage of the currency value of the Forward Contract (the “Forward Contract Value”); or (b) a irrevocable letter of guarantee (the “Letter of Guarantee”) for a certain mutually agreed percentage of the Forward Contract Value.</p></small>

        <h5>9.7 Letter of Guarantee</h5>

        <small><p>The Letter of Guarantee shall: (a) be payable to Anying, (b) be drawn on a Anying approved financial institution, and (c) have a maturity date a minimum of fourteen (14) days after the Value Date of the Forward Contract.</p></small>

        <h5>9.8 Margin Deposit</h5>

        <small><p>Anying may at its sole discretion require the Customer to pay an amount solely determined by Anying (the “Margin Deposit”) if at any time the Mark to Market value (in Australian dollars or other agreed currency) of the Customer’s total outstanding Forward Contracts moves beyond the limit set by Anying for this purpose and the Customer is Out of the Money compared to the original Forward Contract values.</p></small>

        <small><p>The Customer shall pay the required amount on or before the third day after it receives Notice of that amount from Anying. Anying shall have the right, at its sole discretion, to determine the Mark to Market value of funds required on a daily basis.</p></small>

        <h5>9.9 Default</h5>
        If

        <ul>
          <small><li>the Customer fails to complete payment on the Forward Contract as provided herein;</li>
          <li>the Customer fails to pay any Deposit, including any Margin Deposit, to Anying; or</li>
          <li>an Insolvency Event occurs, then the Customer agrees that Anying shall no longer be obliged to fulfill the Forward Contract, or any other existing contract with the Customer, nor to enter into any further contract with the Customer, and Anying may, in its sole discretion:</li>
          <li>(i) sell or buy the necessary covering currency to terminate the Forward Contract and offset the obligations of the Customer under it;
          <li>(ii) charge the Customer with the damages, losses, including loss of profit, incurred by Anying  and shall include additional processing fees, interest, costs and expenses incurred by Anying (collectively referred to as the “Costs”); and</li>
          <li>(iii) set off the Deposit or Margin Deposit held by Anying to pay the Costs. The Customer agrees to reimburse and indemnify Anying forthwith on demand, for all Costs suffered or incurred by Anying which are not covered by the Deposit or Margin Deposit. Any remaining portion of the Deposit or Margin Deposit not required to pay the Costs shall be refunded by Anying to the Customer.</li>
        </small>
        </ul>

        <h5>9.10 Return of Deposit/Margin Deposit</h5>

        <small><p>Subject to Article 9.9, the Deposit, including any Margin Deposit, without interest, will either be returned to the Customer upon the completion of the Forward Contract or will be set off by Anying in settlement of any amount owing to Anying by the Customer at any time under this Agreement</p></small>
